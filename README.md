Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw data for model training.
Model Development: Built and trained a Decision Tree classifier for loan prediction.
Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Applicant Details: Gender, marital status, income, etc.
Loan Details: Loan amount, tenure, credit history, etc.
Target: Loan status (Approved/Not Approved).

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas and numpy for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
sklearn for building and evaluating the Decision Tree Classification model

Model Development
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
Normalized and scaled numeric features for better performance.
Model Training:
Implemented a Decision Tree classifier using sklearn.
Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20% split).
Evaluation:
Achieved 90 accuracy on the test data.

The Decision Tree Classification model successfully predicts loan eligibility based on applicant details. This model can be further improved with more data and advanced techniques such as ensemble methods.
